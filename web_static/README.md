## *0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static*

`HTML`   `CSS`   `Front-end`

By: Guillaume

## *Concepts:*

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [HTML/CSS](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/2)
- [The trinity of front-end quality](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/4)

Background Context
Web static, what?
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.
